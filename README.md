## Pieces of code for Temporal Oxytocin with time-frequencies paper

* **code_MarieStuff.R** runs the main statistical analysis (LMM) and posthocs for *individual frequencies*.
  
  dependencies: nlme, CorrMixed, lme4, lmerTest, geepack, ggplot2, car, emmeans, effectsize, simr
  
  Note: I'm almost sure that some of these libraries are not strictly necessary and/or are redundant, but I know the code runs correctly with all of them installed.
  
* **code_MarieStuff_ACC.R** runs the main statistical analysis (LMM) and posthocs for *cross-frequency-couplings*.
  
  It is very similar to code_MarieStuff.R, with the same dependencies.

* **code_MarieStuff_behav.R** performs statistical analysis of *behavioral scales*: LMM, posthoc correlations, t-tests; plots of behavioral data.

  dependencies: nlme, CorrMixed, lme4, lmerTest, geepack, ggplot2, car, emmeans, effectsize, simr
  (same remark about redundancy of libraries)

NOTE: All this should run as of June 6, 2025. Please contact me with questions or if you spot any mistakes: marie.zelenina@nih.gov.

NOTE1: EEG preprocessing was done in MATLAB; the code is published elsewhere.
See the paper below for reference:
da Cruz, J. R., Chicherov, V., Herzog, M. H., & Figueiredo, P. (2018). An automatic pre-processing pipeline for EEG analysis (APP) based on robust statistics. Clinical Neurophysiology, 129(7), 1427-1437.

NOTE2: To fully reproduce all steps, you'll need MATLAB, Python, and R... Sorry 'bout that. I find that for me Python works best for wrangling data, R for stats, and MATLAB for EEG analysis :-/
